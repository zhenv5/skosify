Skosify release notes

v0.2 - 2011-11-17

Added support for property skosext:candidateLabel. Label properties mapped
to this will be converted to skos:prefLabel if one doesn't exist, but
skos:altLabel if a prefLabel already exists (for the same concept, in the
same language). This makes it possible to prefer some kind of labels, or
labels from a particular source, when there may be many sources of labels.
This is useful for combined ontologies such as TERO and LIITO, where the
"same" concept may have different prefLabels from the different source
vocabularies.
