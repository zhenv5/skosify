v0.6 - 2013-01-29

Release with mostly minor improvements to the code to improve robustness and
correct more problems found in SKOS vocabularies in the wild.

Deterministic cycle breaking, also for top level cycles (#26)
Correct SKOS S14 (no >1 prefLabels per language) for all resources (#24)
Don't break on literal inScheme values (#25)
Correct missing language tag and extra whitespace for rdfs:label (#27)

SKOS inferences for mapping relations (#28)
SKOS inferences for hasTopConcept/topConceptOf and inScheme (#23)
Make some cleanups optional and off by default (#22)
Easier to read --help output with grouped options (r140)
Added sparqldump utility script (r137, r138)

Online version (#16)
Optionally correct unlabeled concept schemes (#13)
Detect referred concept schemes and add rdf:type (#14)
Clean up transitive/narrower relationships (#15)
Make cycle removal optional (#17)
Make cleanup of related relationships optional (#18)
Support different prefLabel policies (#20)
Switch meaning of -i/-I options (r106)

Catch parsing errors properly (r108)

v0.4 

Intermediate version. Not really released.

v0.3 - 2012-02-16

New features (with issue numbers):
Automatically detect vocabulary namespace (#8).
Setting language for labels and documentary notes without language tag (#10).
Better sanitizing of Concept-specific properties on Collections (#11)
Support multiple input files (issue #12)
Support .nt file extension (n-triples format)
Slightly better usage message for --help (show input file parameters)


v0.2 - 2011-11-17

Added support for property skosext:candidateLabel. Label properties mapped
to this will be converted to skos:prefLabel if one doesn't exist, but
skos:altLabel if a prefLabel already exists (for the same concept, in the
same language). This makes it possible to prefer some kind of labels, or
labels from a particular source, when there may be many sources of labels.
This is useful for combined ontologies such as TERO and LIITO, where the
"same" concept may have different prefLabels from the different source
vocabularies.


v0.1 - 2011-05-25

First public version.
