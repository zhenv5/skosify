Skosify release notes

v0.3 - 2012-02-16

New features (with issue numbers):
Automatically detect vocabulary namespace (#8).
Setting language for labels and documentary notes without language tag (#10).
Better sanitizing of Concept-specific properties on Collections (#11)
Support multiple input files (issue #12)
Support .nt file extension (n-triples format)
Slightly better usage message for --help (show input file parameters)


v0.2 - 2011-11-17

Added support for property skosext:candidateLabel. Label properties mapped
to this will be converted to skos:prefLabel if one doesn't exist, but
skos:altLabel if a prefLabel already exists (for the same concept, in the
same language). This makes it possible to prefer some kind of labels, or
labels from a particular source, when there may be many sources of labels.
This is useful for combined ontologies such as TERO and LIITO, where the
"same" concept may have different prefLabels from the different source
vocabularies.


v0.1 - 2011-05-25

First public version.
