Skosify is a tool that can be used to convert vocabularies expressed as RDFS and OWL into SKOS. It can also be used to improve, enrich and validate existing SKOS vocabularies.

See GettingStarted in the wiki for documentation.

An [online version](http://demo.seco.tkk.fi/skosify) of the tool is available, which can be used to perform validation and correction. The online version does not yet support all the options available in Skosify.

The current version of Skosify, version 1.0, was released on 14 January 2014. See the [release announcement](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-esw-thes/2014Jan/0010.html) and [release notes](http://code.google.com/p/skosify/source/browse/trunk/RELNOTES.txt). You can download the file using the Downloads tab. You can also get a copy of the most recent code from the Subversion repository.

Skosify has originally been developed in the FinnONTO projects at the [Semantic Computing Research Group](http://www.seco.tkk.fi/) (SeCo) at Aalto University and University of Helsinki, Finland. The code is open source and available under a permissive MIT-style license. Current development is ongoing at the [National Library of Finland](http://www.nationallibrary.fi/).
